## Project thoughts

I am hoping to analyze coalitions and they're added value for social and environmental movements. I am not sure what data I will use or the exact element of coalitions that I will focus on, but I hope to learn something that will be helpful as I work with my friends to launch a Harvard College Climate Action Coalition!
